# The Ceiling is A Lot Higher

Until very recently, I suffered from the "I Could Land a Plane" syndrome[^1]. This is similar to the feeling you get when watching great athletes in sports and you think to yourself "If it really came down to it, I could do it". Like seeing a runner come second in the Olympics and thinking "they're only a few seconds faster than the winner—how hard could those few seconds really be to make up?" 
I think this syndrome, which to be clear isn't equivalent to self confidence but can easily mask itself as so, often feeding off a history of getting somewhat outsized return from medium-sized effort. I think this is because the median threshold for excellence is a lot easier to cross than it is to get to the pinnacle.

Water on a 80 degree heater will never reach boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. There is simply no amount of wishing or confidence enough to defy the laws of thermodynamics. This is simple but somewhat strange fact to mentally accept. One might think, surely if it's on the heater for long enough it will, but this just isn't the case. This, in tandem, with the 90/10 rule (90% of the work needed to finish up a project is the last 10% of the work).

The ceiling for greatness in any field requires more work than you think, and more personally in the field of enginering. The inital breadfirst knowledge aquired in school or toy projects gets you a lot further than the average person but the work required to get really really good is often understimated. 

The ceiling is a lot higher than you think but it's still reachable, and acknowledging this gets you a step closer and well on your way.
