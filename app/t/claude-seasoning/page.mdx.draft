# Claude Seasoning

---

**NOTE TO SELF: Finish this blog post this weekend.**

---

## Rough Ideas

- the "AGI" feeling - that sense of wonder/mystery about what makes Claude work so well
- like a secret recipe you can't quite decode

### Visual / Meme Concept

The sensation when you:
- drink something so good you stop and wonder "what's IN this thing?"
- take a bite of food that's shockingly delicious and you're genuinely surprised by the quality
- that moment of "wait... how is this so good?"

### Vibe

- mystery, wonder, slight disbelief
- the "seasoning" metaphor: subtle layers, intentional design, unexpected depth
- sensory, visceral - not abstract AI hype
