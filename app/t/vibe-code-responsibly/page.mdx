# Vibe Coding might not exist in the next 3 years

This is a brain dump based on a recent Sam Atman tweet.
-  the openai model lost to a human not using ai. ( this obvuisliy wouldn't persist for the long term but it is fascinatin that some poeple are able to beat a model trained with billions of dollars.)
- if the main differentiator is the skill of vibe coding ( which to be clear, I'm glad exists as it helps create and iterate on ideas a lot faster. ), it might not hold up to the test of time.
-  if in the next 3-10 years we all have personalized coding / truly personal assistants then being able to say "please make Flappy game" and a detailed thought out prompt might be able to achieve the same thing with less iteration and effort. As the current iteration is just the AI not being able to predict / suggest the exact preference the user intended. 
A good analogy is is going to a strabuck that you've been going to for a while now. you can just go there and say "Can I get the usual?" and it just works out perfectly vs going to a new a new starbucks with in a country that you've never been to before that speaks a different language. It might take a couple of tries to get a drink in your exact preference. You might also think you could just save your preference 

`I'd like a Grande Iced Vanilla Latte with blonde espresso, made with oat milk, 2 pumps of vanilla syrup instead of 4, extra shot, light ice, with salted caramel cold foam on top and a caramel drizzle.`

somehwere and have it translated to this new language for this new Starbucks chain. And yes this works but as things get a lot more complex prompts become more difficult to write and understand for the average person. There is currently a craft to steering thhe AI to do what you want using things like xml <put a real example here from github>.
